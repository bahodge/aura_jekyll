                <h2>About Aura</h2>
                <p>Tim Hodge, Colonel (Retired), U.S. Army has dedicated his life to serving others. He devoted 30 years
                    to the soldiers and families of our military through numerous positions of increasing
                    responsibility. Assignments included teaching chemistry at the United States Military Academy (West
                    Point), International Relations at 4 U.S. Embassies in South America, and Chief of Security
                    Cooperation (international relations) with U.S. Army South at Ft. Sam Houston, Texas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After retiring from the Army, Tim recognized that older adults needed an advocate. He believes that
                    older adults can age better, where thriving is normal. With this in mind, he acquired and built
                    Assisted Living Locators to help Seniors and their families find the best senior housing and care
                    options around San Antonio. While helping clients, Tim discovered a significant need among a growing
                    number of older adults. Many older adults are isolated from their adult children and have to manage
                    their own affairs while facing age related diseases and decline. This inspired Tim to start Aura
                    Senior Management, LLC in June of 2018.
                    Tim is a Certified Senior Advisor (CSA)® and has a MS in Biology. He is also is professionally
                    fluent in Spanish.

                    Tim continues to live in San Antonio with his wife. They have 3 adult children and 3 grandchildren.
                    Tim earned the Nation’s trust and confidence to lead soldiers, care for families and manage
                    important programs. You can trust Tim to do the things you would do for your parents if you had the
                    time or lived closer.
